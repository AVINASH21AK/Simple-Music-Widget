This is a simple music widget for Android, which you can add to your home screen, to listen to the music stored in your device

While it's playing music, it will show you the name of the song/artist in the widget itself and in a notification, which also shows up on your lock screen.


The widget and its notification have play/pause/stop/previous/next buttons to control what you are playing.

Your songs will be played in random order.

**Note**: This app will not create a new shortcut in your application drawer. You simply need to add the widget to your home screen.
